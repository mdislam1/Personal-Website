<p>
I am a junior at Wayne State University, majoring in Computer Science. Being a computer science 
student has helped me to develop my critical thinking skills for solving problems. I have 
worked on several real-world problems as part of my coursework’s. This has helped me to gain 
real-world knowledge and helped me to improve my collaborative skills. I am currenly living in 
Detroit. By develping real-world knowledge and skills, I want to help the city of Detroit to 
grow and prosper. I am actively seeking an internship or Co-Op opportunity in the field of 
Computer Science Engineering.
